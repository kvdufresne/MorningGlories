<p class="Section">1 &ensp; Introduction</p>
    <p class="BodyText">In literature courses, a pervasive task is unlearning the association and identification of the author as speaker - especially for poetic works. When readers exclusively read the poet as the speaker, or the “I” of the work, then symbolism, infused meaning, and illustrative images become dubbed as biographical markers - even when fictionalized. In decentering the author as speaker, students and readers are challenged to understand the text as an individual work in <i>addition to</i>, rather than a direct result of, the biographical context it may carry. As Zach Payne writes: “So, when you are reading a poem, your first question shouldn’t be <i>What is the poet saying?</i> Rather ask, <i>What is the speaker saying?</i> In adding that extra lens of nuance, there is a whole world of understanding” (2020). Similarly, <a href="https://english.chass.ncsu.edu/faculty_staff/wjmille3">Jason Miller</a> identifies that a poem is what a moment feels like (2017). But what connections, memories, relationships, ideas are entangled and exasperated by that moment and that feeling?
    <br><br>
    Further complicating this dynamism: texts are in flux. In engaging with Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper” through an arts-based approach with a community of non-experts, Chelsea Bihlmeyer writes: “I observed a relationship between text and context, author and audience in this specific discourse community, who demonstrated three arguments. First, a work is not singular and fixed. Second, meaning is not inherent to a work. And third, meaning is not singular and fixed” (74). As Bihlmeyer’s work emphasizes, we tend to associate literature as that which is stagnant; however, texts change because we do. The way and manner we read something, and what we learn from it, will be different in five, ten, and fifty years. Texts, their lessons and meanings, are in flux because we are. 
    <br><br>
    The fluidity of literature, especially in relation to time, readers, and understanding, aligns with Actor-Network Theory (ANT). ANT posits a greater focus on all facets of a network of associations, including non-human actants (such as trees, worms, clouds, and a feeling of joy) and can assist in encouraging students to consider broader relationships written into the poem, as well as those manifested by the relationship/s between the reader, writer, speaker and poem itself. Thus, this work contributes to the growing field of digital and experiential learning and falling at the nexus of theory and praxis for poetry pedagogy and digital humanities.
    <br><br>
    By employing critical making to construct a video portrayal of the poetic elements and networks, we are able to see how they are constantly in flux, moving and evolving, and specific to any specific reader of a poem. All the more, the fluidity of networks, namely with ANT, juxtaposes the static-nature of poetic materiality. As such, ANT may lead students to also ask <i>What is the very page saying, and what is it saying to the speaker and to me? How are these different?</i> 
    <br><br>
    In exploring this argument, I studied <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=39078">"Morning Glories” by Mary Oliver (1994)</a> to address: How can we study and learn from a poem by prioritizing ANT?

<p class="Section">2 &ensp; Groundings </p>
    <p class="BodyText">
        In calling for ANT considerations among the literary, Rita Felski (2016) notes: “What is an actor? For ANT, it is anything that makes a difference” (748) and “All actors exist via their relations to other actors, and humans are no different in this regard; we depend not only on obvious support systems—food, air, early care-givers—but also on the less obvious: software, serotonin inhibitors, and shoes” (2016, p. 748). Felski’s framing of ANT aligns with John Law’s emphasis the role of non-humans in the social: “networks are composed not only of people, but also of machines, animals, texts, money, architectures - any material you care to mention” (1992, p. 381-382). Similarly, Bruno Latour pointedly addresses that “An actant can literally be anything provided it is granted to be the source of an action” (1996, p. 373). 
        <br><br> 
        Latour demonstrates the capacities of ANT as a method, where “ANT is not about traced networks, but about a network-<i>tracing</i> activity” (1996, p. 378). Such tracing then aligns with Law’s vivid claim that  “social structure is better treated as a verb than as a noun” (1992, p. 389). And of the network, Felski explains that network, and networking, refers to “including as many actors as feasible in our research, the researcher included, and tracing the complexities of their interactions” (2016, p. 749). 
        <br><br> 
        And as we look to a poem on a page, digitally rendered, and mediated through artistic adaptation - Jörgen Schäfer reminds us that “Computer systems and networks are not mere channels for the transmission of messages” (2010, p. 26), and that the digital, the technical, and the electronic are elements needing great consideration in networks (2010, p. 55). As Katherine Hayles writes: “[digital technologies] put into play dynamics that interrogate and reconfigure the relations between authors and readers, humans and intelligent machines, code and language” (2008, p. 186). 
        <br><br> 
        In studying Rita Wong’s poetic works, Matthew Zantingh (2013) similarly argues: “ANT seeks to make materiality and the nonhuman matter by granting them agency, thereby including them in accounts of the social… This theory stems from an attempt to rectify the artificial divide that [Latour] argues emerges from the modern period between the (human) subject and its (nonhuman) object” (p. 627). Importantly, this deconstruction of binaries (namely the human and the nonhuman) aligns strongly with the principles of <i>Data Feminism</i>. As such, I draw upon D'Ignazio and Klein’s call to “embrace emotion and embodiment” as a facet of data feminism (2020, p. 77). They illustrate the harm of false binaries, such as of reason and emotion, which carries a lengthy gendered history, and how “Decorative elements… are associated with messy feelings--or, worse, represent stealthy… attempts at emotional persuasion. Data visualization has even been named as ‘the unempathetic art’ by designer Mushon Zer-Aviv because of its emphatic rejection of emotion” (p. 77). I lean into emotion through this analysis, which also aligns with Donna Haraway’s framing of situated knowledge (1988) as a “practice of objectivity that privileges contestation, deconstruction, passionate construction, webbed connections, and hope for transformation of systems of knowledge and ways of seeing” (p. 585).
        <br><br> 
        <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/concrete-poetry">Concrete poetry</a>, which prioritizes the visual as a rendering of the poem, serves as a valuable framework that this project falls in line with. The <a href="http://www.poetrybeyondtext.org/concrete-poetry.html">Poetry Beyond Text</a> project and research team (Roberts et al., 2011) explains that concrete poetry is a facet of visual poetry: “Drawing upon both textual and visual modes of signification, concrete poetry is thus a hybrid between text and image, and forces readers to oscillate between reading and viewing modes.” Importantly, they emphasize the role of the reader in concrete poetry: “Concrete poetry puts the reader centre-stage: it offers merely incentives, naked linguistic structures, mental play-areas, but it is up to the reader and his or her poetic imagination to fill in the blanks.” As such, we can see how ANT applies to this poetic genre in that it is reliant on the recognition of associations brought in by the reader. Similarly, both concrete and visual poetry are evident in digital poetry (Roberts et al., 2011), where “the digital medium [is used] in a meaningfully distinct manner” with poetic works. Zakiah Noh, Siti Zaleha Zainal Abidin, and Nasiroh Omar (2019) write: “Digital visual art is a nontraditional, computer-generated art form. It conveys information from the poem without emphasizing the detailed features of the poem text. Researchers extract the poem’s meaning and identify its metaphor as a main element in their visual art illustration” (p. 173) and “The advancement in digital technology has brought the traditional method of poetry learning into the digital platform” (p. 193).
        <br><br> 
        Lastly, I am cognizant of the fact that I am working with a published, existing, tangible, and material work - with actants and relationships I may never be fully aware of. As Bihlmeyer (2021) asks: “How does an audience understand and co-create meaning in an object after it has been offered for consumption?” (p. 72). Thus, I draw upon Legacy Russell’s <i>Glitch Feminism</i> (2020) and the role of remixing: “The spirit of remixing is about finding ways to innovate with what’s been given, creating something new from something already there” (p. 134).
        <br><br> 
        As these groundings strive to illuminate, there is much work illustrating the applicability of ANT in the literary realm, yet this work pointedly aims to conjoin ANT, feminist strategies, and digital-based critical making to continue contributing to ANT’s methodological goals as a “network-<i>tracing</i> activity” (Latour, 1996, p. 378).

<p class="Section">3 &ensp; Methods </p>
    <p class="BodyText">
        In order to address how ANT can help students and readers better engage with poetry and further differentiate the author and the speaker, I draw upon Latour (2005) and Law (1992) and their work with ANT to develop a visual-based moving depiction to study "Morning Glories” by Mary Oliver (1994) where I investigate how utilizing this theory and drawing it into poetry lessons can help decenter the role of the author as the “I,” help encourage students to consider non-human actants, and potentially provide richer, more dynamic readings. In doing so, I explored how ANT may permit the reader to create distance from a text by tracing and identifying networks and patterns that they too are part of by identifying and mapping the different relationships, networks, and connections revealed in a poem. 
        <br><br> 
        I selected this poet because I have never read, studied, or worked with Mary Oliver’s poetry in the past, and I gravitated towards this particular poem because of the titular flowers and my personal affinity for nature. Of great note - this poem does not actually invoke the “I” - rather there is an omniscient narrator and speaker, which perhaps furthers my emphasis on divorcing the author from the speaker (with no specificity with the “I” or speaker, we can assess that the speaker could be anyone/everyone/no one). 
        <br><br> 
        As Hayles notes: “the [electronic literature] medium lends itself to experimental practice” (Hayles, 2008, p. 17). Thus, this work relied on great experimentation through creation. In using a standard Windows Video Editor, I generated a video-based collage of my personal network with “Morning Glories.” Before I read the poem, I thought briefly of how I could visually relay the experience of engaging with a poem and its corresponding network, and this continued to evolve as I read the poem, studied it, and tried to represent my readership in relationship to the written word. After generating the video rendition of the network, I also created three data visualizations that explore the same network and relations with <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WIqU0PQDT4svZrDBEr8MjhQgt002tUI70mg6h-hMKXA/edit?usp=sharing">data</a> I compiled from the poem. 
        <br><br> 
        Through this, I strived to offer a supplement to the video, but also craft a juxtaposition between what is traditionally understood as indicative of data - and that which is not.

 <p class="Section">4 &ensp; Morning Glories: a reading with ANT</p>
    <p class="BodyText">
        <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c5r27xmKcPM?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br><br>
        For the purpose of this description, I am focusing on four key facets: 1) me and Mary Oliver, 2)  pacing and cutting of video and/or image, 3) the inclusion of audio, and 4) time. 
        <br><br>
        The above video is deeply personal; rooted in me as a reader at this exact time, in this place, in this particular moment of living and being. The video opens with my hands flipping through my copy of Mary Oliver’s poetry collection, <i>Devotions</i> (2019), emphasizing the identification of a reader. Yet, the absence of a reader’s face, my face, illustrates the ambiguity of my relationship with this poem, this poet, and my understanding. I, like this work, am in flux. Conversely, a singular image of Mary Oliver demonstrates my limited knowledge of her, her work, and her life. The singularity of her representation illustrates how I currently know her.
        <br><br>
        Quick cuts between each individual word of the poem deconstructs the whole into parts; echoing how we would read a poem out loud, word for word. Yet, as the video progresses, this linearity quickly crumbles, as the visualized reading relies on drawn connections and tracings that relays associations: colors, scenes, images.
        <br><br>
        The audio provides another layer to this work. Firstly, my auditory reading of the poem does not align with the visual display of the poem. The disjointed sensory displays thus relay the poem in flux. Secondly, and simultaneously, the sound of birds can be heard -- which I heard and recorded from my home as I read this poem for the first time. 
        <br><br>
        The video itself relays a set time: after a few minutes, it ends. One can watch it again, or not. I see this as a limitation, and simultaneously a great advantage. The finitude revels in the ending, cutting off the display of the networks -- despite the reality of the networks, the associations, and the tracings not bound by this scope of time. Yet, this also illustrates how my reading of this poem, and my connections with and through this poem, may be different tomorrow. A new visualization, or an extended one, would be necessary to capture this.
        <br><br>
        Conversely, the below visualizations serve as juxtaposing network displays. Collectively, all these products relay similar data, and their unified positioning here demonstrates the difference between that which we readily accepted as data (such as the below charts) and that which is not (such as the above video).

<p class="Section">5 &ensp; Concluding Insights </p>
    <p class="BodyText">
        I initially came to this poem and broader project wanting to decenter the “I,” the speaker of the poem, away from the poet, but rather I realized how much we, as readers, bring to a poem and how fully we can saturate ourselves within the networks that this text is a part of.
        <br><br> 
        I compare my reading and my understanding of the networking embedded within and through this poem as that which is cyclical and drill-like: the more time I engaged with the poem and strived to represent it, the more I felt tethered to the poem, to its symbols and images, and the more I identified my own personal and lived experience within the text. As the video strives to illustrate, my understanding of this poem went from visual-symbolism to an eco-feminist reading, and then ultimately to a deeper, far more personally-entaged reading. More specifically, when I started to associate the “reaper” as a farmer, I sifted through digitized family photo albums to find relics of my family’s farm. Boldly apparent to me now is the fact the farm, carrying the family name, is called “Story’s Farm” -- which begs strong alignment to the lines: “The reaper’s story is the story/of endless work… (11-12) and “the story of his life” (16). Thus, the crux of the poem, and my understanding, transitioned from the “beautiful weeds'' (21) to the history of farmers toiling and tending to the earth, season after season, day after day -- enveloping time, space, and my own memories.
        <br><br> 
        In tracing networks, as Law (1992, p. 389) and Latour (1996, p. 378) call for, I arrived at a more dynamic understanding of this poem that reflected my own complicitness and attachment to the various actants relayed in the text. All the more, the process in which I utilized to arrive at this fluid understanding illustrates a break from a fixed and stagnant interpretation of meaning - and favors one that can grow, change, and even diminish without me, beyond me, and with all variations of me.
        <br><br> 
        Poetry is meant to be read out loud, but it is also to be experienced -- and this project strives to achieve just that.

<p class="Section">6 &ensp; Conclusion </p>
    <p class="BodyText">
        In constructing ANT-based visualizations, namely a video-based display, that strived to trace various connections between, across, and through Mary Oliver’s “Morning Glories,” I explored how poetic elements and networks are constantly in flux, moving and evolving, and specified to the reader of a poem. By prioritizing ANT, I focused on all facets of a network of associations, including non-human actants to consider broader relationships written into the poem, as well as those manifested by the relationship/s between the reader, writer, speaker and poem itself. Moving forward, this stand alone project could lead into a more interactive opportunity to invite all readers to engage with tracing networks with this poem.
        <br><br> 
        In the future, more research, spanning the ludic to the academic, should strive to construct and trace networks, such as I have illustrated here, to continue exploring the capacities of ANT, digital concrete poetry, and feminist methodologies in the realm of critical making.

        <b>Discussion Questions</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        How does our experience of reading poetry change when it is not bound to a page?<br>
        What poetic network systems can you identify with this poem or with another one? 
        <br>
        How would you represent the networks you are a part of with literature?
        <br>
        What does it mean to read poetry in this way? 
<br><br>
        <b>Activity</b> 
        <br><br>
        Invite students to work in groups of 3-5 and collaboratively network a poem all together. The following points could be used as a scaffolded networking process. (estimated time 20-45 minutes) 
        <br>
        <br>
        Identify all nouns. How can you categorize them? <br>
            Ex. Nature, City, Places
        <br><br>
        <i>Identify all verbs</i>. What are connected to? What do they reveal?<br><br>
        <i>Identify the themes and symbols</i>. What connections are they reliant upon? Or, what connections do they foster?<br><br>
        <i>Identify the speaker</i>. What role do they play in the poem? How are they connected to the action and the nouns of the poem?<br><br>
        <i>Identify the poet</i>. In what ways, if at all, is the poet represented and connected to the poem?<br><br>
        <i>Identify the readers</i>. How are you connected to the poem? 
        <br><br><br><br>
        After students work through these guiding points and questions, facilitate a class discussion on this process. What was familiar? What was difficult? And what did you learn?
